## Cleaning of the data

These are the main changes that I have made to the data to make it more clean and accurate:

#### 1) Drop 4 districts from the data.


Dropped 4 districts ( 'Medchal' , 'Ranga Reddy', 'Suryapet', 'Vikarabad.) because of no availability of enough data.


#### 2) Edited number of visitors entry.


Edited number of visitors of Hyderabad in the month of June 2016 from **12032661** to **1203266**. Because I feel it's some entry error. The number of visitors in June is more than 10 times larger than average number of visitors in other months, 3 times more than the total population of the city, and there wasn't any data for special celebration or function in that time.


#### 3) Filled missing data for some districts for some months 


Filled missing data for some districts, mainly in the data of the year 2016 with the mean of the visitors to that district.
